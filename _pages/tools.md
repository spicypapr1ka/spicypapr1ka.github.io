LOLBAS is a project that documents binaries, scripts, and libraries that can be utilized for Living Off The Land techniques. It catalogs Windows binaries, scripts, and libraries, aiding attackers in finding potential attack vectors and providing defenders with potential threats. LOLBAS can be useful for CTFs involving Windows systems. For example, its binaries can be used to bypass whitelisting because they are legitimate Windows utilities.
